# The joy of solving little problems

a small project to TeX my old (... from another life) solution to some theoretical physics textbook problems.

Books in scope

+ Srednicki - Quantum Field Theory
+ Schwartz - Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model
+ Kachelriess - Quantum Fields - From the Hubble to the Planck Scale
+ Banks - Modern Quantum Field Theory - A Concise Introduction
+ Burgess, Moore - The Standard Model - A Primer (can't find old solutions - check in Kgs)
+ Woit - Quantum Theory, Groups and Representations
+ Ammon, Erdmenger - Gauge/Gravity Duality - Foundations and Applications
+ Stephani - Relativity - An Introduction to Special and General Relativity
+ Wald - General Relativity (solutions only for selected problems)
+ Weinberg - Cosmology
+ Weinberg - Lectures on Astrophysics
+ Baez - Muniain - Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity
+ Zwiebach - A Frist course in string theory
+ Freedman, Van Poeyen - Supergravity (very limited number of problems solved yet)
+ Dine - Sypersymmetry and String Theory
+ Becker, Becker, Schwarz - String theory and M-theory
+ Hamilton - Mathematical Gauge Theory With Applications to the Standard Model of Particle Physics
+ Nastase - Classical Field Theory (look interesting but not started to really look at the book yet)
+ Le Bellac - Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics
+ Le Bellac - Thermal Field Theory (might be in Albany box)
+ Schwinger - Classical Electridynamics (should be with FSU stuff)
+ Schwinger - Quantum Mechanics - Symbolism of Atomic Measurements
+ Weinberg - Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (only solutions for last chapters)
+ Nielsen, Chuang - Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (look in PB boxes)
+ Thorne, Blandford - Modern Classical Physics (larger number of problems still not done but they are big fun)
